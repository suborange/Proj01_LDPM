 * @version 1.03.F: check all other TODO's left in monster.java; cleaned up comments, and el fin;
 * DESCRIPTION: LDPM - a program that emulates a game of monsters that have types and can attack each other, with modifiers based off certain attacking and defending types.
 * much better than the famous game by nintendo
 */

/**
 * VERSIONS
 * -0.01.a: make all classes, fill out Monster class with all required vars, methods and more.
 * -0.01.b: continue with filling out the foundation to Monster.java; finished getPhrase(), attackModifer(), calculateDefensePoints(), calculateAttackPoints(), and takeDamage();
 *  need to confirm toString() and setPhrase(); cleaned up references and comments
 * -0.01.c: continue with the rest and finish Monster.java; finished setPhrase() and attack();
 * -0.02.a: start implementing the other classes and their functionalities; fully fixed setPhrase using instanceof; Ran through initial test and passed most;
 * -0.03.a: fixed toString() ( it returns all the stuff, duh!!); fixed adding negative attack, causing health overflow; fixed setting the default attackPoints with dice.roll(); all tests passed :)
 * -0.03.b: need to double check Monster(); fixed all method signatures; all tests still pass with flying colors :)
 * -1.03.F: check all other TODO's left in monster.java; cleaned up comments, and el fin;
